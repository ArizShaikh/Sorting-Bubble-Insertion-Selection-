          (c) Bubble Sort

Description : 
        Sorting — arranging items in order — is the most fundamental task in computation. 
        Sorting enables efficient searching algorithms such as binary search.
        Selection, insertion and bubble sort are easily understandable and also similar to each other, but they are less 
        efficient than merge sort or quick sort. 
        
        The basic ideas are as below:
          
          Selection sort: repeatedly pick the smallest element to append to the result.
                    Find the smallest element, and put it to the first position.
                    Find the next smallest element, and put it to the second position.
                    Repeat until all elements are in the right positions
         
          Insertion sort: repeatedly add new element to the sorted result.
                    Take the first element as a sorted sub-array.
                    Insert the second element into the sorted sub-array (shift elements if needed).
                    Insert the third element into the sorted sub-array.
                    Repeat until all elements are inserted.
          
          Bubble sort: repeatedly compare neighbor pairs and swap if necessary.
                    Scan the array, swapping adjacent pair of elements if they are not in relative order. 
                           This bubbles up the largest element to the end.
                    Scan the array again, bubbling up the second largest element.
                    Repeat until all elements are in order.
